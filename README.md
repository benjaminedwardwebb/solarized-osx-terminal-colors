solarized-osx-terminal-colors
=============================

The correct colors for Terminal.app to run Solarized (fixes editor colorscheme)

I've only tested this on Mountain Lion, but the configuration works now.

For Mountain Lion and above:
use xterm-256color

For anyone that doesn't work for:
use xterm-ansi
